Project Title: Tweet Better

'Tweet Better' comes from a team of data scientists and web developers who wanted to help professionals control the tone of their Twitter posts. The key feature of the site is a tweet sentiment scorer, from 0 to 100% positive, that gives feedback on whether a tweet could be unintentionally inflammatory or taken the wrong way. A tweet could be tested several times until you get the score you'd like, and then be posted to Twitter directly from the website.


The project includes using Auth0 to validate the user and give the user access to their twitter credentials.  The user can check their tweet for sentiment and then have an option to post their tweet to twitter.

The frontend portion use redux for state management but also consists of some local state in tweet.js.
